SOLUTION: The wastewater treatment apparatus distributes ozone, an ozone generator, a mixer that mixes ozone supplied from the ozone generator with wastewater and supplies ozone-mixed wastewater, and ozone. The ozone oxidation section that promotes ozone oxidation in mixed waste water and discharges the waste water that has consumed ozone, the biological treatment section that biologically treats the waste water discharged from the ozone oxidation section by microorganisms, and the waste water discharged from the ozone oxidation section.

For example, the crystal structure and volume of the positive electrode active material, which has a layered rock-salt crystal structure in the discharged state and a pseudo-spinel crystal structure in the charged state at a high voltage of approximately 4.6 V, are less likely to be changed by charging and discharging as compared with those of a known positive electrode active material. In order to form the positive electrode active material having the pseudo-spinel crystal structure in the charged state, it is preferable that a halogen source such as a fluorine and a magnesium source be mixed with particles of a composite oxide containing lithium, a transition metal, and oxygen, which is synthesized in advance, and then the mixture be heated at an appropriate temperature for an appropriate time.\\n </div>\\n</abstract>\\n',\n",
